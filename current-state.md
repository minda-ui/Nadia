| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last session | **2026-09-26 — `enquiries@amfa.uk` connector corrected end to end: connectivity verified, access scope decided.** A live check (`search_threads`/`list_labels`) found the mailbox already connected with working **read** access — not "not yet connected, create_draft-only" as `CHARTER.md`/`open-issues.md` (NA-3) had stated. Found: 28 inbox threads, a `Nadia/Triaged` label already holding 24 (mostly fake test-form submissions and marketing/security mail, no real customer enquiries — CRM staying empty is still correct), and one untriaged live supplier thread with ECF (handles/hinges/runners/drawer-door hardware) that a human already replied to directly. NA-3 resolved (connectivity, verified). Owner decision same day (Minda): Nadia may read + create drafts on this mailbox, never send — NA-5 resolved; `CHARTER.md` §Connectors and `Charter-Rules.md` §2 updated to match, `Charter-History.md` logged. NA-6 (ECF thread vs. `quote-pricing.md`'s supplier question) still open. No customer data surfaced outward; nothing sent or labelled. See `Outputs/change-log-2026-09-26-mailbox-access-verified.md` and `Outputs/change-log-2026-09-26-mailbox-access-scope-decided.md`. |
| Last session by | Claude (AI assistant), on behalf of minda@fishboneconstruction.co.uk |
| Role | Amfa Sales & Ops Assistant — enquiry intake, quote drafting, the enquiry-to-order pipeline for Amfa Furniture Ltd (dormant, launch 1 May 2027). Draft-only outward; finance stays Rachel's. |
| Connectors | Google Drive (this KB), Smartsheet (CRM `5405540723328900` read/write; order tracker `5287398789482372` read-only; AI Workforce Hub own rows), Web, GitHub (`minda-ui/Nadia`). Gmail on `enquiries@amfa.uk` — **connected; read + `create_draft`, owner-confirmed 2026-09-26; never send.** No `ops@fishboneconstruction.co.uk` access. |
| Routines | **None live.** Two draft prompts (`Routine-Prompt-Enquiry-Triage.md`, `Routine-Prompt-Quote-Draft.md`) ready for Minda to create via the routines form — the mailbox prerequisite is now met; NA-1 (named draft-reviewer) is still open. |
| Items done | 4 logged. See `processed-items-ledger.md`. |
| Open issues | 4 open, 2 resolved. NA-1 (no named draft-reviewer), NA-2 (umbrella-mechanics undefined), NA-4 (advisory, Amfa git mirror), NA-6 (untriaged ECF supplier thread) open. NA-3 and NA-5 (mailbox connectivity and access scope) resolved 2026-09-26. See `open-issues.md`. |
| Next action | Confirm with Minda whether the ECF thread (NA-6) is the missing door/hardware supplier `quote-pricing.md` needs, and how to capture it. Registration on the group index/Hub Roster is still Victoria's step (unchanged from last session). Once NA-1 is settled, the two routines can go live and Nadia starts real work. |
