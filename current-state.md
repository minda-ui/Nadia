# Current State — Nadia (AI Amfa Sales & Ops Assistant)

_Standing control file. Overwritten by archive-then-recreate at the end of any session that changes
it — present snapshot, not history. Per-session history lives in `Outputs/`. Companion standing files:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last session | **2026-09-27 (evening) — Composio CLI installed and logged in; toolkit linking paused for the night.** Continuing the Composio-rollout proposal: CLI installed pinned (`@composio/cli@0.4.1`), `composio login` completed, `composio whoami` confirms `minda@fishboneconstruction.co.uk` / org `minda_workspace`. `composio setup` (Claude Code plugin integration) was refused by the auto-mode classifier (Unauthorized Persistence) — left alone, doesn't block CLI use. Stopped before step 3 (linking Gmail on `enquiries@amfa.uk` and Google Drive as `nadia-<toolkit>`) — pick up there next session. Earlier the same day: adopted `CHARTER.md`, folded estate-wide **Rule F** into `Charter-Rules.md` §1 (Hub `AWT-0150`), corrected a stale `external-source-register.md` row, closed Hub `AWT-0131`/`AWT-0150`. See `Outputs/change-log-2026-09-27-composio-cli-installed-and-logged-in.md` and `Outputs/change-log-2026-09-27-rule-f-adopted.md`. |
| Last session by | Claude (AI assistant), on behalf of minda@fishboneconstruction.co.uk |
| Role | Amfa Sales & Ops Assistant — enquiry intake, quote drafting, the enquiry-to-order pipeline for Amfa Furniture Ltd (dormant, launch 1 May 2027). Draft-only outward; finance stays Rachel's. |
| Connectors | Google Drive (this KB), Smartsheet (CRM `5405540723328900` read/write; order tracker `5287398789482372` read-only; AI Workforce Hub own rows), Web, GitHub (`minda-ui/Nadia`). Gmail on `enquiries@amfa.uk` — **connected; read + `create_draft`, owner-confirmed 2026-09-26; never send.** No `ops@fishboneconstruction.co.uk` access. Composio CLI installed and logged in (fallback connector layer) — no toolkits linked yet. |
| Routines | **None live.** Two draft prompts (`Routine-Prompt-Enquiry-Triage.md`, `Routine-Prompt-Quote-Draft.md`) ready for Minda to create via the routines form — the mailbox prerequisite is now met; NA-1 (named draft-reviewer) is still open. |
| Items done | 6 logged (1 In Progress — Composio rollout). See `processed-items-ledger.md`. |
| Open issues | 4 open, 2 resolved. NA-1 (no named draft-reviewer), NA-2 (umbrella-mechanics undefined), NA-4 (advisory, Amfa git mirror), NA-6 (untriaged ECF supplier thread) open. NA-3 and NA-5 (mailbox connectivity and access scope) resolved 2026-09-26. See `open-issues.md`. |
| Next action | Resume Composio rollout: link Gmail (`enquiries@amfa.uk`) and Google Drive toolkits (`composio link <toolkit> --alias nadia-<toolkit>`), verify each connection and a real write, log the rollout. Then: confirm with Minda whether the ECF thread (NA-6) is the missing door/hardware supplier `quote-pricing.md` needs. Registration on the group index/Hub Roster is still Victoria's step. Once NA-1 is settled, the two routines can go live. |
